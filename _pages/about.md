Welcome to my personal website. In this webpresence IÂ´d like to give some pointers to some of my previous and present work. Along with my profiles in social media (links on the left) I also maintain this website to show some of my personal projects in the [Blog](https://georgferdinandschneider.github.io/blog) section.  

Special thanks to Stuart Geiger and all people from [@academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages) for providing this excellent template for personal websites.
